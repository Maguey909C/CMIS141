## Introductory Java Course (CMIS141)

### Course Description:
In this course, we will introduce you to the design and implementation of programs using the object-oriented programming language Java. We will begin by showing you how to create, compile, and execute simple programs using the Java software developer's kit (SDK). We will then introduce branching and looping structures and show you how to create subroutines that are referred to as methods in Java. After working with arrays to store and manipulate data, we will end with a discussion of object-oriented concepts, including classes. Throughout the course, we will cover good software engineering procedures as well as ethical issues.

### Note:  
This course is identified as a prerequisite for another course at UMUC.  Successful completion of this course is required to advance to the next course in a sequence. A grade of Withdrawal (W), Failure for non-attendance (FN), Failure (F) or Incomplete (I) will not meet a prerequisite requirement.  You may be barred from enrolling in or may be removed from courses for which you do not have the necessary prerequisites.  Keep track of your progress in this course. If you are uncertain about your standing, consult with your instructor. You should also work with an academic advisor to be sure you are aware of your options and are meeting all necessary program requirements when planning your schedule. 

### Course Outcomes
After completing this course, you should be able to:

design, implement, test, debug, and document programs that use basic data types and computation, simple I/O, conditional and iterative structures, and functions
apply the techniques of structured (functional) decomposition to break a program into smaller pieces
describe and use the mechanics of parameter passing
discuss and use primitive data types and built-in data structures
write clear and comprehensive program documentation
